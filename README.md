# MIS-DocumentManagementSystem
This system aims to reduce paper clutters inside the office.
Instead of consuming space and using paper shelves to keep your
important documents and spend your valuable time trying to find
the documents you kept several months ago, You can just scan
that document and save it in the system and incase you need the
document or someone asks to have a copy of that document, all you
have to do is perform a quick search and print the document.
